        Funtions that interface with the outisde have the option to obtain inputs as tensors or numpy arrays. By default tensor
            sample
            get_probabilities
            get_log_probability
            get_probability

        sample fucntion returns action as a one hot vector so have to change it to an integer before feeding it to the
        enviornment

        state is given as a numpy array
        action_no is given as a numpy array of an action's integer value rather than the one hot vector


Value Fucntions
    Q Value Function
        Funtions that interface with the outisde have the option to obtain inputs as tensors or numpy arrays. By default tensor
            get_value

        both state and action inputs are given as numpy array. Action is given as an array of one hot vector

    Value Function
        Funtions that interface with the outisde have the option to obtain inputs as tensors or numpy arrays. By default tensor
            get_value

        states are given as a numpy array


Suplementary Functions
    Nu and Zeta
        both state and action inputs are given as numpy array. Action is given as an array of one hot vector
